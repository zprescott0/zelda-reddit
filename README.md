# Zelda-Reddit
This project will provide a minimalistic form of Reddit. The user will be able to select subreddits related to various Zelda games on the right, which will cause posts related to that subreddit to show in the rest of the application space.

Each subreddit post will display the title and any text or picture that comes with the post. Furthermore, the post’s number of upvotes and downvotes will be displayed in a small column to the left of the post. We will add another column to the right of the post, which will contain the author and date of the post. More importantly, the column on the right will have a button that can be pushed in order to add the post to a list of favorites. Finally, underneath the post, several comments will display if any are available.

The column of subreddits on the right will actually be hidden at first. By clicking on a fixed button labeled “subreddits”, the subreddits will display in the column on the right. Among the various Zelda-themed subreddits, there will also be a “Favorites” subreddit. This is not a subreddit; it is actually a collection of posts that the user has favorited.
