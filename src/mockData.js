The Zonai, not so much. Idk, I just feel like people are overreacting and I think people will be disappointed come May when there's really nothing much about them in the game.`,

Creating a champion also points out the zonai spiral pattern which kinda looks like the "magatamas" surrounding the giant figure in the latest trailer. \n\nI will admit that we dont *really* know that zonai will be in the game without any doubt, but for now it's easy to just call them zonai as a placeholder name before we get confirmation.`

I don't recall anyone hating on Goron's, Zora, or Ruto as races/tribes that expand the lore and world building a bit better. Zonai could just be that. \n\nIf TotK does nothing with the Zonai other then vaguely allude to them the way they were in BotW, I'm fine with that too. I just want to spend another 150-200hrs exploring every inch of the amazing world Aunuma and his team can craft, and mess around with all the fun new mechanics. \n\nEither way, all the Zelda YouTubers will continue to put out their theories, which can be fun in their own right, even if the theories have no impact on the actual game."
